# Pyomo_SVM
In this notebook we implemented Support Vector Classifier using Pyomo. Pyomo requires us to define mathematical constraint, relations and equations in order to get the Classifier we want to work with. We also tested many different parameters and hyperparameters to fully optimize our Classification Model.
